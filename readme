							#Title:- "string1.h"
********************************************************************************************************************************************
Intro:
	This is an string library

Most important:-  
		all function declaration are in data.h file
		function declaration are in also string.c and definition are there
# Usage:
	*first go into the folder. 
	*make sure that there is file called 'makefile'. 
	*type this command in terminal
         1) make
         NOTE: for next time when you want play just type ./string

	*The main.c file is temparary file which check the code wheater they are working or not.
	 i wrote only some few function which are perfect.
	in main file you excced the array size.
	main file only 9 function are written.

# Controls:
        On compile you got the list.
	first you have to select the option and type the option number and enter.
	After pressing option you have type the value as many time you want.
	if you want to go in option then you have to press clrt+D.
	And if want to end the program then press clrt+D.

# TODO:
	I am going to retype the main.c file and adding some more function in string1.h and string.c.
	making it as actual string library.
	and also i am going to change the string.c file.
